In this sense, this is the most complete security reform project ever presented, since the issue entered the country's agenda with Fernando Henrique Cardoso's inauguration in 1995.
For the problem of growing Welfare imbalances is old, and all the changes that FH, Lula and Dilma were able to do, or wanted to carry out, never went deep into the attack at various points of the system: among others, early retirements; a large gap between the benefits paid to employees in the private sector and to the civil service, in the latter's privilege; and a firm response to the inexorable tendency of the Brazilian system, based on the distribution system, to be made impossible by time, even in the long term, by the inevitable accelerated aging of the population, by the fall in birth rate and a welcome survival of who reaches the age of 62 and 65, which may be the age limit for the retirement of women and men, if the proposed constitutional reform is now approved.
The presentation of the New Social Security coincides with the exotic crisis a policy created within President Bolsonaro's family that resulted in the exoneration of Presidential Secretary General Gustavo Bebianno, who was already demonstrating some transit in Congress and would help Onyx Lorenzoni, chief minister of the Civil House, in the crucial task of negotiating in the Legislature the approval of the reform.

So God made a farmer.
I need somebody with arms strong enough to rustle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.
Somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to wait lunch until his wife's done feeding visiting ladies and tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon and mean it.
So God made a farmer.
God said, I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt.
And watch it die.
Then dry his eyes and say, Maybe next year.
I need somebody who can shape an ax handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make harness out of haywire, feed sacks and shoe scraps.
And who, planting time and harvest season, will finish his forty-hour week by Tuesday noon, then, pain'n from tractor back, put in another seventy-two hours.
So God made a farmer.
God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and yet stop in mid-field and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor's place.
So God made a farmer.
God said, I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bails, yet gentle enough to tame lambs and wean pigs and tend the pink-combed pullets, who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow lark.
It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners.
Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed and rake and disc and plow and plant and tie the fleece and strain the milk and replenish the self-feeder and finish a hard week's work with a five-mile drive to church.
Somebody who'd bale a family together with the soft strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says he wants to spend his life doing what dad does.

Somebody who'd bale a family together with the soft strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says he wants to spend his life doing what dad does.

The idea is great, but these colors and details of the graphics are totally dispensable.
If it was optional, it would already be a good size, even the bracelet is something very cool even for people who are not surfer, like club, river, waterfall make a trail and tals.
I do not find the car beautiful, there is something in front of it that does not short, I think it's the grid. The back really does not look pretty, nothing on it. But this version, for God's sake, if there is nothing new to get attention, leave it as it is selling well. But this one scares with such bad taste.
Does anyone still have the Kicks or March I do not remember now the Olympiad? Those colors were terrible and that one too. Here in my town has brown with white ceiling looks like a sweet with chantily on top.
What a joke! The guy arrives with a colorful Kicks of this at a surf point and becomes an instant laugh at the place.
It's not ugly, but those side charts look like car decal from a business consulting. And I exchanged those details on mustard for a dark metallic gray-robin.
Should come soon with the new range of 1.3-turbo engines Renault-Nissan, Ai yes would make an interesting SUV!
And the autopilot as in Cousin Captur? And the back discs as in the Chinese Kicks? And I did not even mention the weak engine, huh.
This shower is a good idea for everyone who goes to the beach, because it's a bummer to come home full of harness or have to wait a while in the few existing showers. But obviously this will never come true.
I saw a car with that in the car show many years ago, I even had a picnic sitting on the baggage rack wetting all the time, even if I'm not mistaken it was sold, I think it was Suzuki if I'm not mistaken, it came with the hose to take out the sand and with some surfer accessories, but I do not remember the model.
Very good indeed and look, it is the first surf version that was really created for surfers, the others got surfing in name only and static plastic details.
As far as reality is concerned, Nissan is certainly running a market clinic for this version to see if it's worth producing.
I think every Pickup and SUV root should have a shower with a reservoir of 30/40 liters of water to wash hands, feet and shoes. I go fishing a lot on the beach and when I get in the car it's just sand on the legs. Sometimes I take a litter of water.
The tank would have to be removable for cleaning because it very easily soils mud and other impurities.
Buy a costal spray (that rural model) and install it in your car. It has capacity of more than 20 liter and works perfectly for your need.
This is the kind of car that is worthless 5 years later. Same as the Chinese! Parody versions to advertise the car.
As if surfer pothead had money for that.
The truth is that if agent is to analyze the classic profile of owner of every model and brand of car we will is getting away from cars.
Even though the money does not like marijuana, he likes synthetic.
If you lose this key bracelet in the sea will be curled up!
Our bracelet has undergone several tests of resistance and safety for this not to occur. Also, we have the wristband model closed. You can see more information on the website www.surfsemchave.
It really is very safe, very good video, well explanatory, congratulations.
The Fusion solution is better in this case, numeric password on the port. Fusion surfer car.
Also we have the KLS Touch that uses a password system through a Touch keypad installed in the windshield of the car. We'll be posting more information about this model soon.
If I'm not mistaken there is a Suzuki that also has a small shower, being considered useful by those with small children.
